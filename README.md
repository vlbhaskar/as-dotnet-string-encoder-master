# WWT String Encoder

If you're applying for a .NET development position at World Wide Technology Application Services then this is the repo for you!

### Instructions

Your challenge is to implement a string encoding function that will parse input strings into the desired output strings.

BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS:
- Vowels are replaced with number: a -> 1, e -> 2, i -> 3, o -> 4, and u -> 5
- Consonants are replaced with previous letter: b -> a, c -> b, d -> c, etc.
- y is replaced with space
- space is replaced with y
- Numbers are replaced with their reverse: 1 -> 1, 23 -> 32, 1234 -> 4321
- Other characters remain unchanged (punctuation, etc.)
- All output should be lower case, regardless of input case ("Hello World" should produce the same result as "hello world")

Unit tests are provided for you to check your implementation. You are free to change *anything* about the current code so long as you accomplish the goal. You are also free to add unit tests as you see fit, but please do not change the existing tests. Make it read and function the way you want it to, but bear in mind weâ€™re looking for people who understand what best industry practices look like in .NET.
